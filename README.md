# Paranormal Encyclopedia

Paranormal Encyclopedia is a thoughtfully designed reference app dedicated to the unexplained. It explores paranormal phenomena, documented encounters, folklore, psychic abilities, ancient mysteries, and the liminal edges of human belief — presented as a structured, readable archive rather than a feed.

This app is built for curiosity, immersion, and long-form exploration.

## 🧭 Design Philosophy

Paranormal Encyclopedia does not attempt to prove or disprove the paranormal.

It documents ideas, accounts, and theories as cultural artifacts — allowing the reader to explore, reflect, and decide.

Curiosity comes first.

# Paranormal Encyclopedia

Paranormal Encyclopedia is a beautifully designed reference app exploring the unexplained, the supernatural, and the mysterious. It serves as a living archive of paranormal phenomena, folklore, psychic abilities, cryptids, historical cases, and anomalous events from around the world.

Built with modern mobile tooling and designed for clarity, immersion, and offline-friendly reading, Paranormal Encyclopedia is intended to feel more like a digital codex than a traditional app.

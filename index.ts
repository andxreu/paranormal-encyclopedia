/**
 * App Entry Point for Paranormal Encyclopedia
 * 
 * This is the root entry file that initializes the Expo Router application.
 * Expo Router provides file-based routing similar to Next.js.
 * 
 * The entry point:
 * - Registers the root component with React Native's AppRegistry
 * - Initializes the navigation system
 * - Sets up the app directory-based routing structure
 * 
 * Do not modify this file unless changing the routing system.
 * All app code should go in the /app directory.
